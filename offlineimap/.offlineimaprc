# The pre-defined options are:
# Blinkenlights -- A fancy (terminal) interface
# TTYUI         -- a text-based (terminal) interface
# Basic         -- Noninteractive interface suitable for cron'ing
# Quiet         -- Noninteractive interface, generates no output
#                  except for errors.
# MachineUI     -- Interactive interface suitable for machine
#                  parsing.
#
# You can override this with a command-line option -u.
